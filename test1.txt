Have started GIT practice today,and it's going to be fun.
i have succeeded in pushing the code from local repository,and now we proceed to pull to local repository.
i have succeeded in merging the remote repository with my local repository,didn't do 'pull' here,i did 'merge'.
that's all for now,then.`
Alright,tried writing and making changes in the file but couldn't save and quit,so trying now again.let's see.
Hey,it was a successful push,and now pull or fetch or merge is to be done.
okay,it was a successful pull,i did pull command and it worked now,but couldn't edit file after pull.
so had to do fetch and merge as well to vi edit the file.
Now,will do fetch only and edit file through vi editor,if it doesn't work then will do merge.
Nope,git fetch couldn't bring changes from github to local repository,so did git pull and it worked,but can i edit without merge?
yes,this time git pull edit did work,without merge,but i did fetch before pull,so???what is this sorcery?
okay,i pulled this through main but made changes in the secondary in github.let's see.
